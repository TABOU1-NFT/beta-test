# Welcome to the TABOU1 Beta Test!

Thank you for participating in the beta test of our music platform. We appreciate your help in ensuring a smooth user experience. 

In this message, we will guide you through the steps to test the features of our service and access your rewards once you have completed the “test drive”

Are you ready? Let's get started!


## Features tested

In this beta test, we are going to ask you to test and evaluate the following features: 



1. Purchase our main drop
2. Purchase individual songs
3. View your purchases in the “My collection page”
4. Unwrap packages of NFTs 
5. Redeem completed compilation rewards


> Warning:
> 
> To conduct this test, we are using a copy of our website. 
> This copy is hosted on a “test net”. 
> We are going to use simulated means of payment. You will not have to use your own money or credit card or crypto
> The purchases are also simulations of the products we will sell on the TABOU1 platform. 
> However, the rewards you will receive for testing are REAL and will be accessible when the TABOU1 platform is launched


## Credit card or MetaMask

Our platform offers two purchase possibilities: 



1. By using a Credit Card
2. By using coins from a MetaMask wallet 

You can choose the payment method you prefer.


### Choosing Credit card

This is the easiest way to beta test. Just use the fake credit card information below:

1. Enter the following credit card number: 646464646464646
2. Fill in the remaining credit card information with random values (expiry date, CVV, etc.)


### Choosing MetaMask

This step requires adding the MetaMask browser extension. \
/!\ If you already have MetaMask, jump to step 2. \




1. Install the extension on your browser, available [here](https://metamask.io/download/).
2. Connect MetaMask to the Polygon blockchain.

    To connect MetaMask to Polygon, go to “Networks” and “Add network.” In the window that appears, enter the relevant data regarding the Polygon blockchain (GB ca veut dire quoi? Peut on etre + precis?).
