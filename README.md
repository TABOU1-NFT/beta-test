## Fake Credit card or MetaMask with testcoins

Our platform offers two purchase possibilities: 



1. By using a simulated Credit Card
2. By using testcoins from a MetaMask wallet 

You can choose the payment method you prefer.


### Choosing Credit card

This is the easiest way to beta test. Just use the fake credit card information below:

1. Enter the following credit card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
2. Enter the following expiry date : 12/34
3. Fill in the remaining credit card information with random values (full name and CVV)


### Choosing MetaMask

This step requires adding the MetaMask browser extension. \
/!\ If you already have MetaMask, jump to step 2. \




1. Install the extension on your browser, available [here](https://metamask.io/download/).
2. Connect MetaMask to the Polygon blockchain.

    To connect MetaMask to Polygon, go to “Networks” and “Add network.” In the window that appears, enter the relevant data regarding the Polygon blockchain.

3.Choose the Mumbai network and copy the wallet address.

4.  Click on this link: [https://faucet.polygon.technology/](https://faucet.polygon.technology/) Pase your wallet address in the form dedicated and get 0.1 matics (this is the simulated currency we will be using for this step). Again it is free for this beta test.
